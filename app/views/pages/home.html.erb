    This website is not only a portfolio but also a personal note for myself. Blogs will document my experiences of
    struggles, remediations/resolutions to issues, and the home page will have a giant todo unordered list of what I want to
    do with this website. If you are interested, you can click the Show button below. Otherwise, please feel free to
    check out the About page, Blog page, Projects page, and the Resume page via navigation bar up top. Patch notes are
    also linked on the bottom right of the footer.
