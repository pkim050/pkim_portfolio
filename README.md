Hello, welcome to Patrick Kim's portfolio web application.

Here is the production: https://www.patrickaaronkim.com/

Before this, I built a portfolio website where it was a single page of my information and a clickable link that takes you to the PDF of my resume. After several years of gaining professional experience as a Software Engineer, I have decided to create a new portfolio that has more details of not only what I have done in the past, but to also show case of what I wanted to do as well. Essentially, this would be more of a blog than just a simple portfolio.
